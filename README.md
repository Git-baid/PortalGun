# DIY Portal Gun

My 3D printed Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device.
This was printed on a Creality Ender 3 S1 Pro using STL files from [EVARATE on Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3579224). I am a huge Portal fan and I always wanted one of these. Unfortunately, these are hundreds and hundreds of dollars to buy a decent one online so I took a stab at creating my own. I worked on it on and off for 8 weeks as a side project and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

I used PLA filament at 0.2mm layer height for the majority of the project with some transparent PETG for some LED bits like the inner cylinder, top light, and nozzle lighting. The lighting is driven by an Arduino Nano and the sound by an Adafruit [soundboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010M8UOR8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and [amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PY2YSI4?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). The white body parts took a lot of post-processing work as they are both two separate pieces glued together. I hid the seam using a couple of layers of wood filler and lots and lots of sanding. Then a few layers of primer and glossy white spray paint. The black parts I left mostly as is with a little bit of sanding where it needed it.
